# The Wild Oasis - A Hotel Management App

In this project, I used React, TanstackQuery, React Styled Components, Context API, Supabase for the database, and REST API for handling requests from the front end. Recharts for showing the charts related to data. 

Vite is used as a building tool.

## Features

In this project, React is used to handle the UI of the web app, and TanstackQuery is used to handle the remote state using CRUD operations provided by supabase for its PostgreSQL database. In this app, a user can create a cabin and list it for renting out to potential customers, checking in and checking out customers by fetching the data from the server, Authentication and user creation are enabled and maintained by supabase. Data is visualized on the dashboard of the web app with the help of recharts.
